# PrprLive-Node-Documentation
An unofficial attempt at documenting PrprLive's Node Mod

# Under construction
I'm still trying to set down some fundations for this repository. Come back later to see how you can contribute!

# Introduction
**This is NOT official PrprLive product.**

PrprLive is a software that animates Live2D characters using face capture from a webcam, and their target audience is Virtual YouTubers. Here is PrprLive on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1279610/PrprLive/

PrprLive has a paid DLC called **PrprNode Mod**, which enables a menu in the software that allows users to perform graphical programming by dragging and connecting blocks. These allow the user to create interactions and displays that respond to things like keypresses on the keyboard, chat, donations, etc. However, it lacks proper documentation (while it does have a """documentation""" on its website, it is not only too technical for the regular user, but it also doesn't correspond to the in-app blocks!). This repository aims to create a documentation for it.
